# Teletype-Pre-Work-Part-1
This project supplies prospective students with a prototype (also known as a mock-up) to recreate from the ground up using only HTML5 and CSS.  

-There are hints regarding fonts and colors that can be found in the comments of the stylesheet.css file, but the main objective is -- recreate the prototype in the simplest way possible.  
-We only want to see how closely the structural content and visual design can be matched at this time.  
-The buttons DO NOT need to be functional.  It is okay to use Grid or Flexbox, however, DO NOT use Bootstrap.  
-Make sure to use structurally correct HTML5 tags and try to focus on using classes to affect styling.  
-Try not to overuse div elements, id attributes, or !important.  

You will have 24 hours to complete this assignment.  We will contact you to schedule a time to talk through the second part of the Teletype interviews once this portion is successfully completed.
